# Java-Neural-Network
Pure java implementation of a Deep feed forword Neural Network. (No external Dependencies)

Neurone objects forms layer objects and layers form a network object.

# Class defenetions

Architecture : Static class to store the architecture of the network.(how many layers , layer sizes)

Runner : main class to run and test the Neural network

Neurone : Neurone object consist of all the functions and properties there has to be in a typical Neurone of a Neural network

Layer : Layer object consist of an array of neurone and some additional functions are included

Network : Network object consist of an array of layers. The whole network operations can be done using this object
